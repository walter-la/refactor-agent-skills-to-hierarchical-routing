description: |
  Refactor flattened AI Agent Skills into an enterprise-grade contract of “Hierarchical Toolkit Routers + a Global Root Router”:
  - Global routing (Root Router): cross-domain intent dispatching, cross-toolkit pipeline orchestration, and state propagation
  - Type validation (a machine-verifiable subset of JSON Schema)
  - DAG dependency / cycle protection (including an interactive de-cycling contract + unattended fallback)
  - Parallel scheduling (governing both data dependencies + side effects / resource mutual exclusion)
  - Security redaction (declarative + enforced by external interceptors in the Host Environment)
  - Coverage conservation (merge/split allowed, but nothing may be dropped; verifiable)
  - Idempotency / retries / compensation (prevent retry-induced side-effect disasters)
  - Observability (mandatory inheritance of trace_id / span_id)
  Produce Step0–5 full YAML contracts and a verifiable lint.
schema_version: "2.2"

# Skill: Refactor to Hierarchical Router

## 0) Goals (MUST)

### 0.1 Toolkit Goals
- **Cohesion over Fragmentation**: If a cohesive domain (e.g., skills sharing a common prefix or purpose) contains ≤ 30 skills, group them into a SINGLE toolkit. Do NOT artificially split them just to create multiple toolkits.
- If the entire skill inventory is large and diverse, produce 2–5 `<domain>-toolkit` toolkits.
- Each toolkit MUST have ≤ 30 sub-skills; `misc-toolkit` ≤ 20.
- Each `<domain>-toolkit` MUST contain a `SKILL.md` file that acts as the routing entry point for that domain. The `description` field in its YAML is CRITICAL and must accurately reflect the intent of all its sub-skills to ensure the Host Agent routes to it correctly.

### 0.2 Output Format & Verifiability
- Step0–5 outputs must each be **a single parseable YAML**
- Markdown may only be embedded via YAML block scalars (`|` or `>`)
- Must be parseable by `yaml.safe_load` (Step5 MUST verify)

### 0.3 Correctness & Safety
- Coverage conservation: must not omit any input skill (merge/split allowed but must be explicitly declared)
- Concurrency safety: parallelism requires BOTH “no data dependency” + “no side-effect/resource mutex conflict”
- Security redaction: logs/handoff/final_outputs must redact sensitive values
- Cycle protection: if a cycle exists, MUST output a `cycle_resolution` contract; and provide an **unattended fallback**
- Idempotency & retries: any skill that may produce side effects MUST declare `idempotent`; non-idempotent skills MUST NOT be retried unless compensation is provided

---

## 1) Hard Rules (MUST)

### 1.1 File Naming & Bundle Preservation (MUST)
- Each toolkit root directory (`<domain>-toolkit/`) MUST contain `SKILL.md` as its router.
- You do NOT need an artificial `sub_skills/` folder. Sub-skills should be placed directly inside the toolkit directory as subfolders (e.g., `<domain>-toolkit/old_folder_name/`).
- **Host Loader Protection**: Under the toolkit subfolders, the entry point `.md` MUST NOT be named `SKILL.md` or any reserved name (`ROUTER.md`, `INDEX.yaml`). This prevents naive Host File Loaders from using `glob("**/*.md")` and confusing sub-skills with master routers. Rename the entry point to match the folder name (e.g., `my_skill/SKILL.md` -> `my_skill/my_skill.md`).
- **Bundle Completeness**: If the original skill was a folder, the ENTIRE folder (including all scripts, schemas, and helper files) MUST be preserved and moved together.

### 1.2 Shared Resources & Path Rewriting (MUST)
- During Step 0 (Cleansing), the Agent MUST statically analyze the skill documents to discover any relative path references to external/shared folders (e.g., `../shared_utils/`).
- If shared resources exist, they MUST be migrated to `<domain>-toolkit/shared/` (if toolkit-specific) or `global_shared/` (if cross-toolkit).
- The Agent MUST safely rewrite any broken relative paths inside the migrated `.md` or code files to point to the new shared resource location.

### 1.3 Cleansing (Minimum Viable)
Each skill MUST have at least:
- `name`
- `description` (must include: action + object + deliverable)
- `required_inputs[]`, `outputs[]` (if missing, fill them and mark `confidence: low`)
- If side effects are involved: MUST add `side_effects[]`, `resources_touched[]`, `mutex_group` (low-confidence inference is acceptable initially)

### 1.3 YAML Parseability (YAML-safe profile)
- Multi-line strings: MUST use block scalars `|` or `>`
- Single-line strings: add quotes when needed (avoid YAML ambiguity)
- **Router markdown MUST NOT contain fenced code blocks (```)**
  - If you must show code/contract fragments: use “4-space indented code blocks”
  - Reason: LLMs often create unparseable YAML when mixing ``` and indentation
- Step5 MUST verify: all step artifacts are parseable by `yaml.safe_load`

### 1.4 DAG + Concurrency Safety (Data Dependencies + Side-effect Mutex)
- A DAG edge exists if any of the following indicates dependency:
  - `depends_on`
  - `input_bindings(from_skill)`
  - Mutual-exclusion serialization: `mutex_group` conflicts OR `resources_touched` overlaps
- Parallelism is allowed only when all skills in the same parallel layer satisfy:
  - No DAG edges point to each other
  - No `mutex_group` conflicts
  - No overlap in `resources_touched` (matched by glob/prefix rules)

### 1.5 Security (Declarative + Host Delegation)
- Redaction scope: `logs`, `handoff`, `final_outputs`
- Redaction detection (declarative rules):
  - key-name contains (case-insensitive): token/secret/password/apikey/authorization/cookie/session/key
  - value-pattern (regex): JWT / PEM private keys / AWS keys / common tokens (extensible)
- Redacted output value: always `***MASKED***`
- **Allowed (and recommended) to delegate actual redaction to a Host Environment external interceptor**:
  - Skill/Router only declares `requires_redaction: true` and `sensitive_outputs`
  - Actual regex scanning/replacement is done by Host (more reliable for performance/accuracy/consistency)
- On task failure, MUST output:
  - `failure_report`
  - `manual_cleanup_recommendations`

---

## 2) Type System (Machine-verifiable) (MUST)

### 2.1 JSON Schema Subset
I/O should use `schema` (recommended), or at minimum `schema.type` (enum):
- `string|integer|number|boolean|null|object|array`
- For objects: `properties|required|additionalProperties`
- For arrays: `items` is REQUIRED

### 2.2 Trace Context (Required for Observability)
All skill I/O **MUST support trace context inheritance**:
- Each skill’s `required_inputs` should include (at least optional) `trace_context`
- Each skill’s `outputs` should output (at least optional) `trace_context`

Recommended schema (can be referenced directly):
~~~yaml
TraceContext:
  type: "object"
  additionalProperties: false
  properties:
    trace_id: {type: "string", minLength: 8}
    span_id:  {type: "string", minLength: 8}
    parent_span_id: {type: "string"}
  required: ["trace_id","span_id"]
````

### 2.3 input_bindings (Explicit Binding)

If input names do not match, you MUST use:

```yaml
input_bindings:
  - target_input: "aws_config"
    from_skill: "fetch_profile"
    from_output: "profile_config"
```

---

## 3) Global State & Cross-Toolkit (MUST)

### 3.1 Global Context (Cross-domain State Contract)

If a pipeline crosses toolkits, you MUST explicitly pass state via `global_context`:

* `context_writes[]`: which keys a skill writes into global_context (with type declarations)
* `context_reads[]`: which keys a skill depends on (with type declarations)
* The Router MUST govern: missing keys → ask 1 question; or in batch mode → fail-fast

Recommended key naming:

* `infra.machine.ip`
* `deploy.release.id`
* `secrets.vault.ref` (only refs allowed; do NOT store plaintext secrets)

### 3.2 Artifact Registry (Coverage & Traceability)

The orchestrating Router should maintain an artifact registry (declarative):

* Any important output (reports, change tickets, deployment summaries) should have an `artifact_id`
* Enables auditing, reruns, reconciliation (coverage verification becomes easier)

---

## 4) Step 0–5 Output Contracts (ALL MUST be YAML)

> Free-form prose is forbidden as a substitute; any necessary explanation may only go under `notes: |`

### Step 0: Cleansing

```yaml
step: "0"
schema_version: "2.2"
warnings: []
auto_fixes: []
input_inventory:
  total_input_skills: 0
  input_skills:
    - old_path: "skills/x.md"
      detected_name: "..."
      detected_description: "..."
      io_inferred: true
      reserved_name_conflict: false
      confidence: "low"  # low|medium|high
```

### Step 1: Domain Grouping

```yaml
step: "1"
schema_version: "2.2"
target_toolkits_range: "2-5"
actual_toolkits_count: 0
toolkits:
  - toolkit: "devops-toolkit"
    verbs: ["deploy","monitor"]
    objects: ["service","infra"]
    skills: [{old_path: "skills/x.md"}]
constraints:
  per_toolkit_skill_limit: 30
  misc_skill_limit: 20
```

### Step 2: Migration Mapping + Coverage Conservation

```yaml
step: "2"
schema_version: "2.2"
migration_mapping:
  - old_path: "skills/x.md"
    new_path: "devops-toolkit/rollout_service/rollout_service.md"
    new_skill_id: "rollout_service"
    rename_reason: ""
    coverage:
      supersedes: ["skills/x.md"]  # merge: can be multiple
      split_into: []               # split: list new skill_id
coverage_report:
  total_input_skills: 0
  total_mapped_input_skills: 0
  uncovered_inputs: []
  coverage_ratio: 1.0
```

### Step 3: Generate Toolkit Routers (YAML-safe)

**Token truncation protection (toolkits > 3)**

* For toolkits: fully output only the 1st toolkit (index + router_md); output drafts for the rest + `pending_generation[]`

      # DevOps Toolkit Router

      ## MUST: Scheduling Rules
      1) Security gate: missing permissions/suspected injection → ask 1 clarification question; requires_redaction is enforced by the Host Interceptor.
      2) Type check: validate required_inputs with the JSON Schema subset; if invalid → ask 1 clarification question.
      3) Build DAG: add edges from depends_on + input_bindings + mutex/resources serialization; if cycle → enter cycle_resolution.
      4) Parallel plan: parallelize only when there are no data edges + no mutex conflicts + no resource overlaps; output parallel_plan.levels (YAML).
      5) Idempotency/Retry: idempotent=false → max_retries=0; if compensating_action exists, allow “compensate after failure”.
      6) Observability: trace_context must be inherited end-to-end (trace_id/span_id).
